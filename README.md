# 🛒 Bargaining Bazaar
### Bargaining Bazaar is a full‑stack MERN marketplace application that enables users to buy and sell products with real‑time bargaining (chat), secure authentication, and online payments. The platform is designed to simulate real‑world bargaining between buyers and sellers in a digital environment.

### 📌 Project Overview
Bargaining Bazaar bridges the gap between traditional bargaining markets and modern e‑commerce platforms. Buyers can negotiate prices directly with sellers using real‑time chat before completing a purchase.
This project was developed as an academic + skill‑based project and successfully deployed using modern cloud platforms.
